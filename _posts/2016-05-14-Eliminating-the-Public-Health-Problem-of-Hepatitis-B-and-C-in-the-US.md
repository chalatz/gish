On April 11, 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Health and Medicine Division (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) released its Phase One report Eliminating the Public Health Problem of Hepatitis B and C in the U.S.

This report explores the barriers that must be overcome to eliminate hepatitis B and C in the United States. The report reaffirms that hepatitis B and C elimination can be achieved with sufficient resources, commitment, and strategies. NAS also announced that it will now enter Phase Two of this process. A second report, outlining targets, recommendations, and strategies to eliminate hepatitis B and C in the United States will be released in early 2017.
