Patient representatives from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States have advocated for a change in the name of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) to remove the term "cirrhosis," which is often inaccurate histologically, as well as having led to stigmatization of some of these patients. The term cirrhosis is often associated with other causes of liver diseases with particular social implications and as such patients with PBC are sometimes discriminated against in applications for insurance and jobs because of the misunderstanding of their condition this may result in individuals not being able to purchase a home or obtain health or life insurance.
