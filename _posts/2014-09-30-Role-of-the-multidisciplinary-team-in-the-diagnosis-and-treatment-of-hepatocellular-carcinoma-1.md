It has long been appreciated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex disease. HCC is typically preceded by liver cirrhosis, which is itself caused by various types of hepatitis of bothviral and non viral etiologies. Thus, the treatment of patients with HCC requires multiple healthcare professionals, including hepatologists, medical oncologists, surgical oncologists,transplantation surgeons, diagnostic radiologists, pathologists, nurses, nurse practitioners and interventional radiologists. These specialists should meet regularly to review patients’ progress,ensure that treatments are individualized for each patient and agree on next steps. We review case presentations provided by the authors to illustrate the beneﬁts and advantages of the multidisciplinary team matrix in the management of patients with HCC, including the effects of this treatment technique on patient outcome, survival and quality of life.
