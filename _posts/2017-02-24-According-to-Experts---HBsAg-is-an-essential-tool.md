A recently-approved test now allows doctors to measure exactly how much hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) people with chronic hepatitis B have in their blood; so why should patients get this test and how will it help the millions of people around the world infected with hepatitis B?

According to experts, including the Hepatitis B Foundation’s Medical Director Robert Gish, knowing a patient’s HBsAg levels gives doctors:

- A better understanding of what stage of hepatitis B a patient is in;
- A more accurate assessment of a patient’s liver cancer risk; and
- Essential information to judge if it’s time to start or stop treatment.

And in the future, this test may be critical to finding a cure.
