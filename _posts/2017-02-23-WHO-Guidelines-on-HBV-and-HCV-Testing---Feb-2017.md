**About the guidelines**

These are the first WHO guidelines on testing for chronic HBV and HCV infection and complement published guidance by WHO on the prevention, care and treatment of chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection. 

These guidelines outline the public health approach to strengthening and expanding current testing practices for HBV and HCV, and are intended for use across age groups and populations.

The primary audience for these WHO guidelines are country programme managers and health-care providers, particularly in LMICs, responsible for planning and implementing hepatitis testing, prevention, care and treatment services.
