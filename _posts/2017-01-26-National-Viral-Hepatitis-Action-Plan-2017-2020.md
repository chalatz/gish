Dear Partners,

Attached is the final version of the updated National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2017 – 2020 for informational purposes as the final document is currently being prepared to comply with Section 508 requirements and posted online in the coming weeks.

Please mark your calendars for a webinar on the Action Plan on Wednesday, February 15, 2017 at 3 – 4 PM EST. A save-the-date will be sent in the coming days.

We look forward to working with you to implement the plan and to hear about your ideas on how we can further coordinate and expand efforts to meet our national viral hepatitis prevention and care goals for 2020.
