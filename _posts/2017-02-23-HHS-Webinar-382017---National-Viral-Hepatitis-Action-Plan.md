Join us in the fight as we move towards realizing the vision of the Action Plan:

The United States will be a place where new viral hepatitis infections have been eliminated, where all people with chronic hepatitis B and C know their status, and
everyone with chronic hepatitis B and C has access to high quality health care and curative treatments, free from stigma and discrimination.

The webinar will include:

- Key viral hepatitis facts and gaps in the United States
- Overview of the National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2017 – 2020
- What’s new/changed in the Action Plan
- Perspectives from the Office of Minority Health on the importance of the Action Plan
- Perspectives from national and state partners on the Action Plan

The [National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2017-2020 (Action Plan)](https://jumpshare.com/v/UH6CQeyivFKTtOWXuhwk) is posted and ready to share at www.hhs.gov/hepatitis. This Action Plan represents a new phase in our efforts and is the nation’s roadmap for addressing viral hepatitis in the United States.

Developed collaboratively by 23 federal partners from the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and Veterans Affairs with input from non-federal stakeholders from a variety of sectors, the Action Plan recognizes that success cannot be achieved by federal action alone. The support and commitment of a broad mix of stakeholders from various sectors, both public and private is needed to achieve our national goals.

Everyone has a role to play in the battle against viral hepatitis in the United States.
