**Overview**

Chronic HBV infection is characterized by the interaction between the virus, the immune system, and the liver itself. This interaction may also be caused by medications that modulate the immune system, resulting in HBV reactivation and potential liver injury. Thus, it is critical for clinicians involved in managing patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy to be vigilant of the potential for HBV reactivation.  

In this (15-minute) CME activity, Dr. Robert Gish will discuss the prevention of HBV reactivation in patients who will undergo immunosuppressive therapy, including screening those at risk, identifying risk-level based on serologic profile and intensity of immunosuppression, and initiating prophylaxis antiviral therapy.
