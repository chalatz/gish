We  have  been  very  fortunate  to have  progressed  from  the  discovery  of  the  hepatitis  B virus (HBV)  to  a  highly  effective  vaccine  in  a relatively short period of time. Even with the vaccine availability, providing it universally to areas of high endemicity is still challenging.  

Unfortunately, for individuals chronically infected, approximately more than 400 million, risk for the end-stage manifestations of cirrhosis and liver cancer remain globally problematic. We now have efﬁcacious, safe therapies that work to suppress viral replication, but challenges and areas of opportunity still exist in our management of patients infected with HBV.  

In  this  monograph,  the  timing  and  treatment  options  for  this  disease  are  discussed, and  the goals of  determining  true  immuno-logic  phenotypes  based  on  more  than  ALT and HBV DNA, which is clinically important since  many  patients  are  in  a  gray  http://library.robertgish.com/7i6bZdIzone that does  not  ﬁt  the  current  guidelines,  are  concisely summarized. Monitoring  and  determining the end-points  of  HBV  therapy  are  addressed  and a  look  at  resistance,  cross  resistance, and strategies for salvage are detailed. Also, the available  data  on  long-term safety and options for therapeutic cessation is assessed. Ending therapy is an evolving area and it is clear that while HBsAg loss and sero-conversion is the “holy grail” of hepatitis B, it is rare and may take several years to achieve. ........
