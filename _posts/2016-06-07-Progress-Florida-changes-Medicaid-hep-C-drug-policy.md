[**Florida changes hep C drug policy for Medicaid**](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/article81120382.html)

Florida health officials are changing the state's policy for administering costly hepatitis C drugs to Medicaid patients and will now require insurance companies to provide the drug at an earlier stage in the disease. Three organizations sent the state a demand letter in April warning that the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration's policies violate patient rights under the Medicaid Act.
