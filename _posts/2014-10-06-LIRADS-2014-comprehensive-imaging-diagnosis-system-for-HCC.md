The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) was created to standardize the reporting and data collection of CT and MR imaging for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This method of categorizing liver findings for patients with cirrhosis or other risk factors for developing HCC allows the radiology community to:

- Apply consistent terminology

- Reduce imaging interpretation variability and errors

- Enhance communication with referring clinicians

- Facilitate quality assurance and research
