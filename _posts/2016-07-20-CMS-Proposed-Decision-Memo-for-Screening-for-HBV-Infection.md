COMMENTS CLOSED

CMS has released its proposed decision memo for hepatitis B screening coverage.

CMS concluded that HBV screening will be covered for all high risk individuals entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A or enrolled under Part B. 

The caveat is that in order for the screening to be covered, it must take place in a primary care setting.

The proposed decision is open for public comment until August 6, 2016. It's time to speak up!  You may submit a comment directly online via the link below.
