[End Hep C SF](https://endhepcsf.org/) is a multi-sector collective initiative employing evidence-based practices, community wisdom, and the creative leveraging of resources to work toward hepatitis C elimination in San Francisco.  Although Hep C focused... the model is applicable across all viral hepatitis elimination efforts.  

MOST NOTABLE about this initiative is their decision to address the very real challenge to multi-sector coalition building. 

Supporting End Hep C SF is [The Collaboration for Impact](http://www.collaborationforimpact.com/), an innovative and structured approach to making collaboration work across government, business, philanthropy, non-profit organisations and citizens to achieve significant and lasting social change.

*Thank you to Miranda Sedillo, MS, Program Planning Manager, HCV Programs, ECHO Instituteâ„¢ University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, for cheerleading 2016 WHD and sharing the recently published SF HCV elimination plan ([endhepcsf.org](https://endhepcsf.org/)).*
