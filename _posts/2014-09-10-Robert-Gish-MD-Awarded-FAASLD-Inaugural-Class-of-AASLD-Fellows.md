More information will be sent to you in the coming days about this special designation and special events taking place during the upcoming Liver MeetingÂ® in Boston, Massachusetts in November.

Congratulations again and we look forward to your future contributions, now as an AASLD Fellow!

Kind Regards,

Adrian M. Di Bisceglie, MD, FAASLD, FACP
AASLD President
