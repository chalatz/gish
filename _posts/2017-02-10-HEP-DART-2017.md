**FRONTIERS IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT FOR HEPATOLOGY, INCLUDING VIRAL HEPATITIS, NASH, AND CO-INFECTIONS**

Welcome to the website of HEP DART 2017!

We are pleased to invite you to the 22nd biennial HEP DART meeting. This year, the meeting will be held on 3-8 December in Kona on the gorgeous island of Hawaii.

The focus of HEP DART is to assemble clinicians, medical professionals, nurses, researchers and basic scientists together to advance our knowledge of the ongoing drug development processes in the treatment of viral hepatitis, NASH, and co-infections.

HEP DART 2017 will uniquely blend the areas of biology, chemistry, pharmacology and clinical research to provide the scientific community with an increased understanding of the current and future challenges in hepatology (including viral hepatitis, NASH, and co-infections). Key points of the meeting will be basic science and clinical medicine.

The program will include plenary lectures, abstract- and poster presentations, and discussion & debate. There will be plenty of time for Q&A in the panel discussions scheduled at the end of each session and more than enough occasions to unwind, relax and socialize with your colleagues!

We hope you will be joining us this year and we look forward to seeing you in Hawaii!

**EARLY REGISTRATION DEADLINE IS APRIL 2, 2017**
