**Introduction**

This case presents a complex treatment-experienced patient with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Recommendations from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD/IDSA) for the assessment and treatment of genotype-3 patients with decompensated cirrhosis will be applied. Promising data on recently approved and emerging regimens will be discussed in the context of treatment challenges for this subpopulation.
