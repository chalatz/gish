The adoption of World Health Organization (WHO) Viral Hepatitis Strategy in May 2016 signals the first step in eliminating viral hepatitis.  

Below are the first WHO guidelines for the prevention, care and treatment of persons living with chronic hepatitis B infection, released March 2015.

The primary audience for these WHO guidelines is country programme managers in all settings, but particularly in low and middle-income countries to help plan the development and scale up of hepatitis B prevention, care and treatment. These guidelines are also intended for health-care providers who care for persons with CHB in these settings.
