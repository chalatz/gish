**Goal Statement**

To provide important clinical data on the management of hepatic encephalopathy.

**Target Audience**

This activity has been designed to meet the educational needs of gastroenterologists, hepatologists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners involved in the care of patients with chronic liver disease. 

**Statement of Need/Program Overview**

The goal of this program is to improve healthcare providers competency in understanding the long-term effects and potential liver related complications of chronic liver diseases. The program will also provide education on management options and outcomes of treatment. 

**Educational Objectives.** Upon completion of this activity, participants should be better able to:

1) Assess the benefits of primary prophylactic therapy for cirrhotic patients with covert hepatic encephalopathy and of secondary prophylactic therapy for patients who have recovered from an overt hepatic encephalopathy episode. 

2) Evaluate data that suggest cognitive impairment following an episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy may not be completely reversible and that impairment from recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy may be cumulative.
