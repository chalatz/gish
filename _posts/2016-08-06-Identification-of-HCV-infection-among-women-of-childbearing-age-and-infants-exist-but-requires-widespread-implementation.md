The national increases in HCV detection among women of childbearing age, HCV testing among infants, and the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected motherssuggest increased risk for mother-to-child transmission of HCV. This risk might be higher in certain areas of the United States, as illustrated by the findings in this report for Kentucky, which might be related to increasing illicit injection drug use.
