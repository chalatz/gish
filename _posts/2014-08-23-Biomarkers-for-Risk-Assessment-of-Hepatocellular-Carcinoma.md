Hepatocellular Carcinoma is the number two cause of death worldwide from cancer.

AFP-L3 (lectin-reactive alpha fetoprotein) and DCP (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) are the only biomarkers cleared by the US FDA for clinical use for risk assessment of HCC development. 

AFP-L3 and DCP are intended for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid in the risk assessment of patients with chronic liver diseases for development of HCC in conjunction with other laboratory findings, imaging studies, and clinical assessment. The combined use of these biomarkers has been shown to be more sensitive and effective for the early detection of HCC through surveillance.
