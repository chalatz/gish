Living with Hepatitis B fact sheet in new languages

The “Living with Hepatitis B” fact sheet is now also available in Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese. 

Redesigned website

The Know Hepatitis B campaign materials page has been redesigned with language tabs! Hopefully this will make it clearer that it is possible to sort the campaign materials by language. The language list on the left hand side is also now expanded by default, so you can also navigate from there.

New language-specific URLs  
Each in-language tab has its own address if you'd like to share a specific link with your local partners:
