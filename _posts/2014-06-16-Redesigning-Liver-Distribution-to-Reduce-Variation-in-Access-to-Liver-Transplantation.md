The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) is charged with developing a national transplant system that uses objective criteria, based on medical evidence, to provide all candidates nationwide with equitable access to transplantation. Where there are significant disparities, there is opportunity for improvement. Even so, many factors contribute to these disparities, and no single approach can equalize the experience of all candidates nationwide. 

The OPTN/UNOS Liver and Intestinal Organ Transplantation Committee recently released a concept document on liver distribution for review and a public comment in a forum scheduled on Tuesday, September 16, 2014 in Chicago.
