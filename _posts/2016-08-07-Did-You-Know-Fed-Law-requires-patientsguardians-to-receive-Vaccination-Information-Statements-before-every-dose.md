What's a VIS?

A VIS or Vaccine Information Statement is a document, produced by CDC, that informs vaccine recipients - or their parents or legal representatives - about the benefits and risks of a vaccine they are receiving.

According to Federal Law - the appropriate VIS must be given:


- Prior to the vaccination (and prior to each dose of a multi-dose series); 

- Regardless of the age of the vaccinee;

- Regardless of whether the vaccine is given in a public or private health care setting.

The Most Current Version Must Be Used.
